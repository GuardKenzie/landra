# About Landra

![](media/landra.png)

> Landra was a member of the Guard and at one point the quartermaster for the Guard's equipment. As of the winter of 1152, following Rand's grim injuries, Landra was promoted by Gwendolyn to the rank of Captain of Lockhaven's Defenses: a job which required her to track the movements and the expected arrivals and departures of Guardmice on their various patrols. Being incredibly pragmatic and organised, she made a natural replacement for Rand.
